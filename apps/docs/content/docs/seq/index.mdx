# Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams provide a visual representation of how objects interact in a particular scenario of a system. They show the flow of messages between different components or services over time, making it easier to understand the dynamic behavior of a system.

## Features

### 📊 Visual Message Flow

Sequence diagrams illustrate the chronological order of messages exchanged between different actors (users, systems, services, databases, etc.) in a particular scenario.

### 🎯 Use Cases

- **API Interactions**: Document how different services communicate during API requests
- **Authentication Flows**: Show the step-by-step process of user authentication
- **Transaction Processing**: Visualize payment or transaction workflows
- **Data Synchronization**: Demonstrate how data flows between systems
- **Error Handling**: Document exception and error handling scenarios

### 🛠️ Supported Tools

This documentation supports sequence diagrams using:

- **Mermaid** - For inline sequence diagrams directly in MDX
- **PlantUML** - For more complex sequence diagrams with advanced features

## Available Sequence Diagrams

### Account

- [Create Customer](account/create-customer) - Sequence diagram for customer creation flow

## How It Works

Sequence diagrams in this documentation are rendered using the same diagram-as-code approach as other diagrams in the system. Click on any diagram to open it in a full-screen zoomable viewer.

### Example Structure

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Actor
    participant B as Service
    participant C as Database
    
    A->>B: Request
    B->>C: Query
    C-->>B: Response
    B-->>A: Result
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Actor Names**: Use descriptive names for participants
2. **Message Flow**: Show both request and response flows when applicable
3. **Activation Boxes**: Use activation boxes to show when an object is active
4. **Loops and Conditions**: Use appropriate syntax for loops and conditional flows
5. **Error Handling**: Include error scenarios to document exception handling
6. **Time Ordering**: Arrange messages chronologically from top to bottom
