# Context

To ensure account security, user passwords **must meet the requirements specified below**.

## Scope

- **Applies to**: All registered users
- **Effective Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Review Date**: Yearly

## Standards

### Password Requirements

A valid password must contain **at least one character from each of the following categories**:

- **One uppercase letter** (A–Z)
- **One lowercase letter** (a–z)
- **One numeric digit** (0–9)
- **One special character** (for example: `! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } ; : , . ? /`)

Passwords that do not meet these requirements will be rejected.

### General Recommendations

- Passwords should be sufficiently long (e.g., **minimum 8 characters** or more).
- Avoid using easily guessable information such as names, dates, or common words.
- Do not reuse passwords across multiple systems.

### Password Expiration

- Passwords **expire after a defined period** : 1 year.
- Systems should propose users to change password.
- Previously used passwords **cannot be reused** for a defined number of cycles. For now: last 1 password.
