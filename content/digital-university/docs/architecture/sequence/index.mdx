Sequence diagrams show how components interact over time for various operations. Diagrams are organized by client/actor.

## About Sequence Diagrams

- **The Goal:**
  - It maps out the "talk" between components—showing exactly who initiates an action, what data is sent, and in what order it happens.
- **The Layout:**
  - It reads like a timeline. Vertical lines (Lifelines) represent the participants, while horizontal arrows (Messages) represent the flow of information. Time flows from top to bottom.
- **The Use Case:**
  - It is the "gold standard" for documenting logic flows, such as a user logging into a website or an API communicating with a database.
