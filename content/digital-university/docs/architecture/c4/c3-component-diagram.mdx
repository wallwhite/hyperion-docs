## Key Points

- **Authentication (AuthController, AuthService)**: Designed in [ADR-003](/docs/digital-university/architecture/adr/ADR-003-authentication-strategy), not yet implemented
- **Statistics**: OpenAPI spec declares Statistics tag but no endpoints exist yet
- **Public Controllers**: Provide read-only access without authentication for guest users
