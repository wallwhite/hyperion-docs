## About

The C4 model provides a hierarchical set of diagrams:

1. **System Context** - Big picture
2. **Container** - High-level technical blocks
3. **Component** - Components within containers
4. **Code** - Class diagrams (rarely needed). NOTE: we use **Service diagrams** instead.

## Explanation of levels

### System Context Diagram

- **Goal**: to show what the system is, who interacts with it, and for what purpose.
- **Focus**: external actors (users, other systems) and the system itself as a “black box”.
- **Questions it answers**:
  - Who uses the system?
  - Which external systems are integrated?
  - What role does the system play in the business context?

### Container Diagram

- **Goal**: to show the internal structure of the system — its main components/services (containers), how they interact with each other, and how they interact with the external world.
- **Focus**: any executable unit, such as a web application, microservice, message queue, etc.
- **Questions it answers**:
  - What are the main building blocks of the system?
  - How do these parts communicate with each other?

### Component Diagram

- **Goal**: to show the internal structure of a single container — which modules or components it consists of and how they interact.
- **Focus**: logical parts of the code (classes, services, controllers, repositories, etc.).
- **Questions it answers**:
  - How is the code organized inside the container?
  - Which core services implement the business logic?

### Code Diagram (are not used here)

- **Goal**: to show implementation details — how a component is implemented at the level of classes, functions, or modules.
- **Focus**: usually not a mandatory level, but useful for documenting complex or critical parts of the system.
- **Questions it answers**:
  - How is this component implemented?
  - Which classes, interfaces, and patterns are used?
