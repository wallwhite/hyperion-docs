# Writing Guide

This guide covers writing style, formatting standards, and content guidelines for Hyperion Docs documentation.

## Technical Documentation Tone

- Use clear, concise language
- Write in present tense
- Use active voice when possible
- Be specific and precise
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (define terms when used)

### Examples

**Good**:
> The API validates input before processing the request.

**Avoid**:
> The API will be validating input, and then it might process the request.

## Code Examples

Use fenced code blocks with language specification:

````mdx
```bash
pnpm dev
```

```typescript
const example: string = "value";
```
````

### Code Block Guidelines

- Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
- Include comments to explain complex logic
- Keep examples focused and minimal
- Provide complete, working examples when possible

## Command Formatting

Format commands as inline code or in code blocks:

```mdx
Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
```

For multiple commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

## Link Formatting

Use descriptive link text:

```mdx
{/* Good */}
See the [diagram usage guide](./diagram-guide) for details.

{/* Avoid */}
Click [here](./diagram-guide) for details.
```

### Internal Links

- Use relative paths for links within the docs
- Link to related documentation when helpful
- Keep link text concise but descriptive

## Headings

### Hierarchy

Use hierarchical heading structure:

```mdx
# Page Title (H1)
## Main Section (H2)
### Subsection (H3)
#### Detail (H4)
```

### Guidelines

- Use title case for H1
- Use sentence case for H2 and below
- Keep headings concise and descriptive
- Don't skip heading levels (H1 → H3)

### Examples

**Good**:
```mdx
# Architecture Decision Records
## When to Create an ADR
### Examples of ADR-worthy decisions
```

**Avoid**:
```mdx
# ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORDS!!!
## When You Should Create An ADR
#### Examples
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Use for items without specific order:

```mdx
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

### Ordered Lists

Use for sequential steps:

```mdx
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

### Checkboxes

Use for requirements or task lists:

```mdx
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Completed task
```

## Tables

Use tables for structured data:

```mdx
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
```

### Table Guidelines

- Keep tables simple and scannable
- Use header row to label columns
- Align text appropriately
- Consider using lists if table becomes too complex

## Callouts and Alerts

Use blockquotes for important information:

```mdx
> **Note**: This is an important note.

> **Warning**: This action cannot be undone.
```

## File and Path References

When referencing files or directories:

```mdx
- File: `content/project-name/docs/index.mdx`
- Directory: `content/project-name/diagrams/`
- Relative: `diagrams/architecture.puml`
```

## Inline Code

Use backticks for inline code elements:

```mdx
The `<Diagram>` component renders diagrams.
Set the `lang` parameter to `"plantuml"`.
```

## Emphasis

### Bold

Use for important terms or UI elements:

```mdx
**Important**: Always validate input.
Click the **Submit** button.
```

### Italic

Use for emphasis or introducing new terms:

```mdx
The *primary key* uniquely identifies each record.
```

## Paragraphs

- Keep paragraphs focused on one idea
- Use blank lines between paragraphs
- Aim for 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- Break up long blocks of text with headings or lists

## Examples and Templates

### Provide Context

When showing examples, explain what they do:

```mdx
Example: Creating a simple sequence diagram

\`\`\`plantuml
@startuml
User -> System: Request
System --> User: Response
@enduml
\`\`\`

This diagram shows a basic request-response interaction between a user and system.
```

### Use Placeholders

Use clear placeholders for variable content:

```mdx
`/docs/architecture/{project}/adr/`
`ADR-{number}: Decision Title`
```

Common placeholder patterns:
- `{project}` - Project name
- `{number}` - Sequential number
- `{topic}` - Topic or category name
- `{lang}` - Programming language

## Accessibility

### Alt Text for Diagrams

Always provide descriptive alt text:

```mdx
<Diagram
  lang="plantuml"
  path="project-name/diagrams/architecture.puml"
  alt="System architecture showing docs app, API route, and Kroki service with data flow arrows"
/>
```

### Descriptive Links

Make link text meaningful:

```mdx
{/* Good */}
See the [solution design template](../templates/solution-design).

{/* Avoid */}
See [this](../templates/solution-design).
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Unclear Antecedents

**Avoid**:
> The system processes the request and sends it to the database. It returns the results.

**Good**:
> The system processes the request and sends it to the database. The database returns the results.

### 2. Passive Voice Overuse

**Avoid**:
> The configuration file should be updated by the administrator.

**Good**:
> The administrator should update the configuration file.

### 3. Unnecessary Words

**Avoid**:
> In order to start the server, you need to run the command.

**Good**:
> To start the server, run the command.

### 4. Ambiguous Instructions

**Avoid**:
> Update the file.

**Good**:
> Update the `config.yaml` file with your API credentials.

## Terminology

### Consistency

Use consistent terms throughout:

- Choose one term and stick with it
- Don't alternate between synonyms
- Create a glossary for project-specific terms

### Common Terms

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| authentication | auth (in formal docs) |
| configuration | config (in formal docs) |
| repository | repo (in formal docs) |
| documentation | docs (except in titles/names) |

## Versioning and Dates

### Date Format

Use ISO 8601 format:

```mdx
**Date**: 2024-01-28
**Last Updated**: 2024-01-28
```

### Version Numbers

Use semantic versioning:

```mdx
Version 1.0.0
Version 2.1.3
```

## Review Checklist
