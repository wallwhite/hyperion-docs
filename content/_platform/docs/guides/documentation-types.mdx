# Documentation Types

This guide explains the different types of documentation we maintain and when to use each one.

## Documentation Types Overview

| Type | What | When to Create | Location | Example |
|------|------|----------------|----------|---------|
| **ADR** | High-level architectural decisions + WHY | When choosing architecture approach | `/docs/architecture/{adr}/` | "Trunk-based development", "Microservices architecture" |
| **Agreement** | Technical standards and conventions | When selecting specific tools/practices | `/docs/agreement/` | "PHPStan level 8 for PHP", "ESLint rules for TypeScript" |
| **Process** | Workflow - WHO, WHEN, WHAT sequence | When establishing new team process | `/docs/process/` | "Duty Process", "Branch Strategy" |
| **Solution Design** | Feature/project design document | Before implementing major features | `/docs/architecture/solution-designs/{number}/` | Feature design, System design |
| **Test Design** | Testing strategy for feature | Together with Solution Design | `/docs/architecture/solution-designs/{number}/` | Feature test plan, QA strategy |
| **C4 Diagram** | Architecture visualization (4 levels) | When architecture changes | `/docs/architecture/c4/` | System Context, Container diagram |
| **Sequence Diagram** | Step-by-step component interactions | When showing flow between services | `/docs/architecture/sequence/` | Payment flow, Auth flow |
| **ERD** | Data structure and relationships | When designing/changing database | `/docs/architecture/erd/` | Database schema |
| **OpenAPI** | REST API specification | When creating/modifying API | `/openapi/` | API endpoints, schemas |
| **Strategy** | Architectural strategy documents | For long-term direction | `/docs/architecture/strategy/` | Modernization approach |

## When to Use Each Type

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
**Use when**: You need to document a significant architectural decision that will impact the system long-term.

**Examples**:
- Choosing microservices vs monolith
- Selecting a database technology
- Deciding on authentication approach
- Trunk-based development vs GitFlow

**Template**: [ADR Template](../templates/adr)

### Agreement
**Use when**: Teams need to agree on technical standards, conventions, or tool configurations.

**Examples**:
- Code style rules (ESLint, Prettier configs)
- Linter levels (PHPStan level 8)
- Testing requirements
- Code review standards

**Template**: [Agreement Template](../templates/agreement)

### Process
**Use when**: You need to document a workflow that involves multiple people and steps.

**Examples**:
- Duty support rotation process
- Branch strategy and PR workflow
- Release process
- Incident response procedure

**Template**: [Process Template](../templates/process)

### Solution Design
**Use when**: Planning a significant feature or system component before implementation.

**Examples**:
- New payment processing feature
- Email notification system
- API versioning approach
- Data migration plan

**Template**: [Solution Design Template](../templates/solution-design)

### Test Design
**Use when**: Creating solution design - always pair these together.

**Examples**:
- Test strategy for new feature
- QA checklist
- Performance testing approach
- Integration test plan

**Template**: [Test Design Template](../templates/test-design)

### C4 Diagram
**Use when**: Documenting system architecture at different abstraction levels.

**The 4 Levels**:
1. **System Context**: High-level view showing users and external systems
2. **Container**: Major building blocks (apps, databases, services)
3. **Component**: Internal structure of containers
4. **Code**: Class-level details (optional)

**See**: [Diagram Guide](./diagram-guide#c4-architecture-diagrams)

### Sequence Diagram
**Use when**: Showing interactions between components over time.

**Examples**:
- API request flow
- Authentication process
- Payment transaction
- Data synchronization

**Template**: [Sequence Diagram Template](../templates/sequence-diagram)

### ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
**Use when**: Designing or documenting database schema.

**Examples**:
- Database schema design
- Data model documentation
- Schema migration planning

**Template**: [ERD Template](../templates/erd)

### OpenAPI
**Use when**: Defining or documenting REST APIs.

**Examples**:
- API specification
- API contract definition
- API documentation

**Process**: Create YAML spec → Run `pnpm build:openapi` → Generated docs appear

### Strategy
**Use when**: Documenting long-term architectural direction or approach.

**Examples**:
- Migration from monolith to microservices
- Technology modernization plan
- Platform evolution roadmap

## Best Practices

### Choose the Right Type

- **ADR for decisions**: Document WHY you chose something, not just WHAT
- **Agreement for standards**: Document what teams agreed to follow
- **Process for workflows**: Document WHO, WHEN, WHAT
- **Solution Design before code**: Always design before implementing features

### Pair Related Documents

- **Solution Design + Test Design**: Always create together
- **ADR + Agreement**: Decisions often lead to standards
- **Process + Guideline**: Workflows often need implementation guides

### Keep Documents Focused

- One document = one purpose
- Link between related documents
- Avoid duplicating information

### Update Regularly

- Mark ADRs as Deprecated/Superseded when no longer valid
- Review Agreements periodically
- Keep Solution Designs as historical record (don't delete)
